Cantor this idea of mine, is SystemVerilog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog

That's it, they have done it all! Precisely, they support enums which do bit packing by default, gives perfect control of the hardware, is compiled, does extensive checking for every value... It's perfect!

I'm unsure if I consider my research done or not, for a case I wanted to develop a new language based on Set Theory instead of Type Theory and we'll I got pretty close. There's still the gap for the perfect "Set Theory Programming Language". But I'm not sure that's the problem I want to solve, because certainly no developer is screaming that they want a complete different way to see and understand computation. In this case we would definite computation as: The representation of a range of possible values. On which the computer is just a Machine with Finite States.

Here are some other languages with similar ideas:

* B-Method https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-Method
* TLA+ https://github.com/tlaplus
* Finite State Language https://fsl.tools/
* JavaScript State Machine https://github.com/StoneCypher/jssm
